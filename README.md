# python-RSA

Python implementations of a few Bayesian inference models in the Rational Speech Act framework.

+ [Frank and Goodman (2012)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6084/998): The simple model presented in that initial paper. Almost a "hello world" for the RSA framework.

+ [Lund et al. (2019)](https://gunnarnl.github.io/publications/2019-lundetal.pdf): An implementation of an RSA model that captures historical change as change in *utterance cost*.

## TODO:

+ Clean up the implementation of the lexical uncertainty model used to capture the Jespersen's cycle of negation that I originally implemented in WebPPL (which is [here](https://github.com/gunnarnl/negative-cycle)).
